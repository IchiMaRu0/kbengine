# KBEngine- An Open Source MMOG Server    Engine

![kbelogo1](https://github.com/IchiMaRu0/kbengine/blob/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%94%E7%BB%84-%E8%BF%9B%E5%BA%A6%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/pics/kbelogo1.png)

## Abstract

An open source MMOG server engine. 

Just use Python scripting to be able to complete any game logic simply and efficiently (supports hotfixing).

Various KBEngine plugins can be quickly combined with (Unity3D, OGRE, Cocos2d-x, HTML5, etc.) technology to form a complete game client.

The engine is written in C++, and saves developers from having to re-implement common server-side 
technology, allowing them to concentrate on game logic development, to quickly create a variety of games.

## Introduction



## Stakeholders  


&ensp;&ensp; Stakeholders are the people that have interest in this Kbengine project and this organization. A stakeholder is a member of the "groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist". Stakeholders can obviously have their effect on the project's policy as well as the objective. In this section, we will firstly provide an overview of the different stakeholders identified by the project such as developers, maintainers, assessors users and so on. Hereafter, we will discuss how the issues and integrations are handled. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> will show the summary of identified stakeholders of Kbengine based on the classification proposed by Nick Rozanski and Eoin Woods<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.  

### Overview  

**Acquirers:**&nbsp;[YOLO Technology](https://www.comblockengine.com/aboutUs.html) is managing and growing the company and its assets.  


**Suppliers:**&nbsp;The development of Kbengine is coordinated via [Github](https://github.com), which can be safely classified as a supplier. Also, as Python is the scripting language for the engine, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is also regarded as a supplier.


**Developers:**&nbsp;Kbengine is supported by an open source [community](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine/graphs/contributors) and by YOLO's engineers. In total, there are 25 Git contributors, among whom the top three recent contributors are:  

1. @[kbengine](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine/commits?author=kbengine) 3,707 commits 
2. @[kebiao](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine/commits?author=kebiao)  367 commits
3. @[basesrv](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine/commits?author=basesrv) 89 commits. 

Developers deploy the Kbengine software and try to polish it.  

**Communicators:**&nbsp;There is a large [community](https://bbs.comblockengine.com/) for this highly-regarded open source project. More than four thousand active communicators are now in the community, continuing explaining the system to other stakeholders via documentation and other materials like demos.  


**System adminstrators:**&nbsp;Due to the features of the open source project, it is relatively difficult to draw a conclusion on who the adminstrator is, but there is no denying that [YOLO Technology](https://www.comblockengine.com/aboutUs.html) works as a regular adminstrator.

**Testers:**&nbsp;Testers test the project to ensure that it is suitable for game development. Users as well as developers all serve as the testers for this project.  

**Users:**&nbsp;This group include both big companies like [Electronic Soul](https://www.dianhun.cn/) and average users who are attempting developing their own games.  

**Competitors:**&nbsp;Undoubtedly, competitors are interested in the development of Kbengine since they are willing to provide a competing service. [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/zh-CN/what-is-unreal-engine-4) and [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/cn) are two big names with the most users worldwide. The former one is widely viewed as one of the most powerful engine for  and the latter one is suitable for beginners around the world. Nevertheless, when it comes to the game server engine or framework, [POMELO](http://pomelo.netease.com/) and [SKYNET](https://github.com/korialuo/skynet) are two that win most reputation.

### Power-Interest Grid  

&nbsp;&nbsp;The power-interest grid contains the main stakeholder categories, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. There is no doubt that the core developer team takes the leading position in the figure. Suppilers like Github are also significant because the open source project highly depends on these third-party dependencies. Whereas, they apparently have little interest in this project. On the contrary, it is the users that have the highest interest while possess the lowest power.
